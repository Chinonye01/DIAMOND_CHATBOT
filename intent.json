                  "The primary goal of autoencoders is to compress input data into a smaller representation, while still retaining the essential information. This approach helps to reduce the dimensionality of the data, which can be helpful for various machine learning applications such as image analysis and natural language processing. Autoencoders also have applications in feature extraction and data visualization."]
